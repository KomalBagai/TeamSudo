## Safety and Security Assurance Network
The main motive of our system is to provide a safer environment for passengers travelling by cab services(specially women passengers) with the help of a decentralised system using Blockchain. The system contains a hardware module consisting of a camera, GPS and Microphone. This integrated system connects the cabs and the police station in case of any abnormal condition with the help of audio analysis and computer vision.

A decentralized cab security system which includes a hardware module in the cabs to be put by the owner of the cab service in order to ensure high security of the passengers. The microphone attached to the hardware module is responsible for audio analysis and hence scream detection. As soon as a scream spectogram (high frequency, amplitude and pitch) is detected by the hardware module, a notification alongwith a snapshot of the particular instant is sent to the nearest police station arriving en route of the cab. The police can thereby analyze the image and make sure if any abnormal activity is happening or is about to happen.
