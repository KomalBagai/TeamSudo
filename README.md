The main motive of our system is to provide a safer environment for women and improve response time to citizens in case of emergencies by
making citizens take up vigilante roles. Also, our system helps the organisations to be supervised to see if timely actions are being
taken or not, all this through an inter-linked web involving an audio-interrupt based module, blockchain, audio processing, IoT and an android application to make it all accessible.
